// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

// Function 
num1 + num2 = sum
7 + 5 = 12

print sum
12

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

// Get integer
Input: number (integer) 

number <- input("Enter a number: 12")

// Check if integer is divisible by 2, i.e. even
if number % 2 == 0 THEN

    print "The number is even."
    
else

    print "The number is odd."


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

// Step A:
DECLARE numbers AS ARRAY OF 5 INTEGER
FOR i FROM 1 TO 5 DO
    numbers[i] <- input("Enter number " + i + ": ")
END FOR

// Step B: 
DECLARE sum AS INTEGER <- 0
FOR i FROM 1 TO 5 DO
    sum <- sum + numbers[i]
END FOR
average <- sum / 5

// Step C: 
DECLARE min AS INTEGER <- numbers[1]
DECLARE max AS INTEGER <- numbers[1]
FOR i FROM 2 TO 5 DO
    IF numbers[i] < min THEN
        min <- numbers[i]
    END IF
    IF numbers[i] > max THEN
        max <- numbers[i]
    END IF
END FOR

// Step D: 
PRINT "The average of the five numbers is: " + average
PRINT "The smallest number is: " + min
PRINT "The largest number is: " + max

END
