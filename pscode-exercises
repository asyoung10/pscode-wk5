// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

// Function 
Function:
num1 + num2 = sum
7 + 5 = 12

print sum
12

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
// Get integer
Input: number (integer)
Input: 12

// Check if integer is divisible by 2, i.e. even
Function:
if number % 2 == 0 

print "The number is even."
    
else

 print "The number is odd."


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

// Step A:
Declare numbers as an array of 5 intergers

Numbers: 1, 6, 8, 14, 21


// Step B: 

Numbers: 1, 6, 8, 14, 21

Function:

num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = sum

1 + 6 + 8 + 14 + 21 =

average = sum / 5

10 = 50 / 5


// Step C: 
Numbers: 1, 6, 8, 14, 21

Decalre min as 1

Decalre max as 21


// Step D: 
print "The average of the five numbers is: + average

print "The smallest number is: + min

print "The largest number is: + max
